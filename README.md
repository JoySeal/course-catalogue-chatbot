# GPT-4 & LangChain - Create a ChatGPT Chatbot for Your PDF Files
Tech stack used includes LangChain, Pinecone, Typescript, Openai, and Next.js. 
[Tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih9PBGVVOO4)

## Development
2. Install packages
First run `npm install yarn -g` 
yarn install
3. Set up your `.env` file

4. In the `config` folder, replace the `PINECONE_NAME_SPACE` with a `namespace` where you'd like to store your embeddings on Pinecone when you run `npm run ingest`. This namespace will later be used for queries and retrieval.
Pinecone needs 1536 dimensions.

5. In `utils/makechain.ts` chain change the `QA_PROMPT` for your own usecase. Change `modelName` in `new OpenAI` to `gpt-4`, if you have access to `gpt-4` api. Please verify outside this repo that you have access to `gpt-4` api, otherwise the application will not work.
**This repo can load multiple PDF files**
1. Inside `docs` folder, add your pdf files or folders that contain pdf files.
npm i d3-dsv
`npm run ingest` 
npm install --save @emotion/react

## Run the app
 `npm run dev` 

## Troubleshooting
- Make sure you're running the latest Node version. Run `node -v`
- Try a different PDF or convert your PDF to text first. It's possible your PDF is corrupted, scanned, or requires OCR to convert to text.
- `Console.log` the `env` variables and make sure they are exposed.
- Make sure you're using the same versions of LangChain and Pinecone as this repo.
- Check that you've created an `.env` file that contains your valid (and working) API keys, environment and index name.
- If you change `modelName` in `OpenAI`, make sure you have access to the api for the appropriate model.
- Make sure you have enough OpenAI credits and a valid card on your billings account.
- Check that you don't have multiple OPENAPI keys in your global environment. If you do, the local `env` file from the project will be overwritten by systems `env` variable.
- Try to hard code your API keys into the `process.env` variables if there are still issues.

**Pinecone errors**

- Make sure your pinecone dashboard `environment` and `index` matches the one in the `pinecone.ts` and `.env` files.
- Check that you've set the vector dimensions to `1536`.
- Make sure your pinecone namespace is in lowercase.
- Pinecone indexes of users on the Starter(free) plan are deleted after 7 days of inactivity. To prevent this, send an API request to Pinecone to reset the counter before 7 days.
- Retry from scratch with a new Pinecone project, index, and cloned repo.
